A guidance and control function that is a function of both fin rate and fin deflection.
I.E. Over this time period I receive this amount of fin deflection with this rate.
Observe in a flat plane.
Use a stable missile.
The advantage of this is to create a missile that will be fired ballistically and:
	if launched at angles phi - 0 degrees, theta - 45 degrees, psi - 0 degrees
	the missile will settle at psi 0 degrees
	and phi 0 degrees
	I can then analyze pitch alone.
	Then test roll.
	Finally implement 
	Yaw should be very similar to pitch.
